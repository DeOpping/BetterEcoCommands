# BetterEcoCommands
For EssentialsX users
***

This plugin was created to help those with EssentialsX economy commands, but, any economy provider for Vault will work as well!

This plugin will not replace **anything** in the economy provider for Vault!

**Vault and an economy provider (like EssentialsX) is required!**
